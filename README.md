## Functionality

Most of the work so far has been focused on architecture and making the UI work with a basic level of polish and expected features. This has come at the expense of the core functionality of the calculator itself. To see the available functionality check [the functionality docs](docs/functionality.md)

## Architecture

The architecture for the project as a whole and for each crate is described in [the architecture docs](docs/architecture.md)
